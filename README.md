So here is the plan, in case you miss today's meeting.

if you havent done your module 14, or challenge 14 yet plz do so.

the only reason i highly recommend you to to this exercise is becuase, that is pretty much what we are going to build up for this project. i mean if you already understand what is going on then we can get this pretty easily

So, Im going to build up the all the apis(routes), controller, models, and all the functioning stuff so 
Khan and Kaya you guys get work on your front-end (i assuming you are all going to use MVC). then after build up some of the handlebars then 
Austin can build up Javascript to get fetching and btns to work properly.

while I am working on Apis just if you could please plan out how the html and css goes, and Austin I know you are working on module 14 so nice work please keep work on that. 

after i finishing up, i mma going to slack out so you guys can git pull from the branch. 

i think the communication is the key for this project. so please if anything comes up. do not hesitate to slack out, I will be standby, and be with you as much as i can.

thank you guys really appriciated
